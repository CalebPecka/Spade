      <b>Value Propositions</b>
	<ul>
		<li> We are offering value in economics, time efficiency, customer loyalty, and transportation information. We believe the most feasible way to combine these needs is through online retail. Products we offer would be in the form of small general convenience items that either stores benefit from selling, or that large quantities of people could need. Services would be an online system for people to collaborate and communicate on which products they want to bulk purchase. Transactions could be supported by credit card transactions or PayPal.</li>
		<li> People want to pay lower prices for everyday items. We want to provide a way to sell items at a cheaper cost through the value of bulk purchasing. </li>

      <b>Customer Relationships</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Customers are going to love us. Customer satisfaction is essential to our business plan that combines exceptional customer service with social media to effectively provide great service and communication for maintaining relationships. Our customers can expect high quality products in a timely fashion as well as transparency about the whole process to ensure clarity and assurance. We will gain potential customers’ attention with our transparency and excellent communication skills and retain them with the timely and high quality services we provide. </li>
	</ul>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="2">
      <b>Customer Segments</b>
	<ul>
		<li> One customer segment we would like to target is small-business owners. Economically they are searching for valuable deals, often purchasing products in bulk to supply and fund their business. They have a need for a diverse set of products. The problem is that they can’t afford to spend a large amount of money on those products to get a return investment. <\li>

      <b>Key Resources</b>
			<ul>
				<li> <i>Physical:</i> We will need access to the physical products and means to transport them to the various locations. We will have trucks to transport the goods from shipments to the pick up locations. We would also need small storage locations to store the customer’s purchased goods for the duration of about a week. </li>
				<li><i>Intellectual:</i> We will have a trademark for the Spade Brand, a Copyright for our logo, and information in our databases.</li>
				<li><i>Human:</i> To conduct our business processes, we will need warehouse workers, IT personnel, a marketing team, and general hierarchical leadership positions. We will also maintain rich connections with various manufacturers to purchase the products as well as workers to transport the physical products.</li>
				<li><i>Financial Assets:</i> Spade will need necessary finances to purchase and deliver the physical products and will be done by not purchasing products until they have been purchased through our business. That is, we will purchase products from the manufacturers in bulk after enough people expressed interest in it through the website to ensure it is profitable. In addition, we will use PayPal and credit/debit cards to conduct all our consumer transactions.</li>
			</ul>

      <b>Channels</b>
 	<ul>
	<li> Customer engagement through Spade is instigated through online contact. As such, it makes natural sense to use online advertisements to acquire initial customers. We will initially do this through advertising services such as YouTube. We believe a large part of our customer audience would be college students and likely YouTube users. According to our online statistics, over 80% of users in the United States use YouTube, and the largest unique visitors are between the ages of 25 and 34. YouTube also has the added benefit of automatically tailoring their ads through ad personalization. We will provide customer support through a hired calling service which users can learn about through an online phone-number. We will also have a live chat after seven years of economic prosperity.</li>
	<li> We have decided to reach the most amount of customers that we are marketing to by utilizing social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. Not only will these sites allow us to communicate updates and events but also raise awareness of our brand and service. Through social media customers will also be able to see deals that will direct them to our service. We will provide links to popular products with good deals to incentivise usage of the service and promote loyalty. As mentioned previously, customers can evaluate all of our purchasing options online. The more a certain product is purchased, the cheaper its price becomes based on our bulk purchasing model. The most successful products, or the products which are popular among a set of consumers, will be directly advertised through social media to individuals. This could be achieved through an automated programming service. </li>
