## Summary of Business
Our goal is to create a service for people to get the benefit of the affordable cost of buying in bulk while also receiving any small quantity they desire. This will be accomplished with an online community-based ordering service. Customers will specify what they would like to purchase and when enough people are interested, we deliver the desired product at a lower cost to everyone.

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Cost Structure</a></b>
      <p> Our three most important costs are transportation, product storage, and company staffing. Our key resources are the products which we wish to purchase from manufacturers and then resell. These products are net inherently expenisve. Rather, the process and logistics of transporting these products is far more expensive. The most expensive key activity is warehouse storage. Ownership of the warehouse as well as warehouse management both play roles in the cost of maintaining such a large scale business. Assuming exponential scaling, Spade will cost an estimated $750,000 to run its first year: $1.4 million its second year: and $2.5 million its third year. (We would consider roughly $500,000 from the first year costs as the cost to establish the company.)</p>

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Revenue Streams</a></b>
      <p> Our sources estimate that the average customer is expecting to spend $100 on a combination of grocery/retail items per usage of website. In an online economy, it only natural that people will want to pay with digital transfer methods such as credit cards and pay pall. Assuming an average of 53 transactions per day on our first year, combined with logistic growth, we expect to have a net profit of $223,000 on our first year: $374,000 on our second year: and $1,066,000 on our third year.</p>
