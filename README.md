      <b>Key Resources</b>
			<ul>
				<li> <i>Physical:</i> We will need access to the physical products and means to transport them to the various locations. We will have trucks to transport the goods from shipments to the pick up locations. We would also need small storage locations to store the customerâ€™s purchased goods for the duration of about a week. </li>
				<li><i>Intellectual:</i> We will have a trademark for the Spade Brand, a Copyright for our logo, and information in our databases.</li>
				<li><i>Human:</i> To conduct our business processes, we will need warehouse workers, IT personnel, a marketing team, and general hierarchical leadership positions. We will also maintain rich connections with various manufacturers to purchase the products as well as workers to transport the physical products.</li>
				<li><i>Financial Assets:</i> Spade will need necessary finances to purchase and deliver the physical products and will be done by not purchasing products until they have been purchased through our business. That is, we will purchase products from the manufacturers in bulk after enough people expressed interest in it through the website to ensure it is profitable. In addition, we will use PayPal and credit/debit cards to conduct all our consumer transactions.</li>
