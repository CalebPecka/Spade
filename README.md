## Summary of Business
Our goal is to create a service for people to get the benefit of the affordable cost of buying in bulk while also receiving any small quantity they desire. This will be accomplished with an online community-based ordering service. Customers will specify what they would like to purchase and when enough people are interested, we deliver the desired product at a lower cost to everyone.

      <p> Our sources estimate that the average customer is expecting to spend $100 on a combination of grocery/retail items per usage of website. In an online economy, it only natural that people will want to pay with digital transfer methods such as credit cards and pay pall. Assuming an average of 53 transactions per day on our first year, combined with logistic growth, we expect to have a net profit of $223,000 on our first year: $374,000 on our second year: and $1,066,000 on our third year.</p>
