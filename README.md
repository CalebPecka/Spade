## Summary of Business
Our goal is to create a service for people to get the benefit of the affordable cost of buying in bulk while also receiving any small quantity they desire. This will be accomplished with an online community-based ordering service. Customers will specify what they would like to purchase and when enough people are interested, we deliver the desired product at a lower cost to everyone.

		<li>Customers are going to love us. Customer satisfaction is essential to our business plan that combines exceptional customer service with social media to effectively provide great service and communication for maintaining relationships. Our customers can expect high quality products in a timely fashion as well as transparency about the whole process to ensure clarity and assurance. We will gain potential customers’ attention with our transparency and excellent communication skills and retain them with the timely and high quality services we provide. We will also provide a personal connection to our customers that make them feel like they are buying from someone they know and trust. </li>

      <b><a href="Customer_Segments.md">Customer Segments</a></b>
	<ul>
		<li> One customer segment we would like to target is small-business owners. Economically they are searching for valuable deals, often purchasing products in bulk to supply and fund their business. They have a need for a diverse set of products. The problem is that they can’t afford to spend a large amount of money on those products to get a return investment. </li>
		<li> Our customer segment is middle class society that has a direct interest in value and affordability for household products. Several niche customer segments include college students who are very interested in cost minimization, as well as small businesses who need a consistent and local form of transportation for acquiring mass products. Our online business will function as an online shopping service that allows people to request products, and once a product query has reached a certain quantity threshold, that product will be delivered to our businesses warehouses, where they are eventually distributed. We believe the most economically feasible products to begin with are grocery products - fruits, vegetables, canned goods, etc. After 2 years of economic success, we will increase product diversity by moving into household products such as cleaners. After 5 years, we will delve into bulk electronics. Seeing 20 years into the future, it is not economically impossible that we could investigate the sale of bulk yachts and private jets.</li>

 	<ul>
	<li> Customer engagement through Spade is instigated through online contact. As such, it makes natural sense to use online advertisements to acquire initial customers. We will initially do this through advertising services such as YouTube. We believe a large part of our customer audience would be college students and likely YouTube users. According to our online statistics, over 80% of users in the United States use YouTube, and the largest unique visitors are between the ages of 25 and 34. YouTube also has the added benefit of automatically tailoring their ads through ad personalization. We will provide customer support through a hired calling service which users can learn about through an online phone-number. We will also have a live chat after seven years of economic prosperity.</li>
	<li> We have decided to reach the most amount of customers that we are marketing to by utilizing social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. Not only will these sites allow us to communicate updates and events but also raise awareness of our brand and service. Through social media customers will also be able to see deals that will direct them to our service. We will provide links to popular products with good deals to incentivise usage of the service and promote loyalty. As mentioned previously, customers can evaluate all of our purchasing options online. The more a certain product is purchased, the cheaper its price becomes based on our bulk purchasing model. The most successful products, or the products which are popular among a set of consumers, will be directly advertised through social media to individuals. This could be achieved through an automated programming service. </li>

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Cost Structure</a></b>
      <p> Our three most important costs are transportation, product storage, and company staffing. Our key resources are the products which we wish to purchase from manufacturers and then resell. These products are net inherently expenisve. Rather, the process and logistics of transporting these products is far more expensive. The most expensive key activity is warehouse storage. Ownership of the warehouse as well as warehouse management both play roles in the cost of maintaining such a large scale business. Assuming exponential scaling, Spade will cost an estimated $750,000 to run its first year: $1.4 million its second year: and $2.5 million its third year. (We would consider roughly $500,000 from the first year costs as the cost to establish the company.)</p>

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Revenue Streams</a></b>
      <p> Our sources estimate that the average customer is expecting to spend $100 on a combination of grocery/retail items per usage of website. In an online economy, it only natural that people will want to pay with digital transfer methods such as credit cards and pay pall. Assuming an average of 53 transactions per day on our first year, combined with logistic growth, we expect to have a net profit of $223,000 on our first year: $374,000 on our second year: and $1,066,000 on our third year.</p>
