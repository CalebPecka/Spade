# T1: Business Opportunity and Market Feasibility
## Spade: Business Concept Overview
Our goal is to create a service for people to get the benefit of the affordable cost of buying in bulk while also receiving any small quantity they desire. This will be accomplished with an online community-based ordering service. 

## Assignment Tasks
**Task:** Select team leader for current assignment.
	<br /> -Team Leader: Caleb Pecka
	
**Task:** Select a specific customer segment (or related group of customer segments). Describe the customer segment(s) clearly, either demographically, economically, geographically, etc. What needs do these customers have? What problems do they need solved? Consider how these customers could benefit from an online business.
	<br /> -One customer segment we would like to target is small-business owners. Economically they are searching for valuable deals, often purchasing products in bulk to supply and fund their business. They have a need for a diverse set of products. The problem is that they canâ€™t afford to spend a large amount of money on those products to get a return investment. 

**Task:** Develop the value propositions you would want to offer the customer segment(s). Consider a wide range of possibilities such as online retail, non-profit, business-to-business, or government contracting. Consider products, services, information, and/or transaction support. (If you select a non-profit business, it must be able to sustain itself financially.)
	<br /> -We are offering value in economics, time efficiency, customer loyalty, and transportation information. We believe the most feasible way to combine these needs is through online retail. Products we offer would be in the form of small general convenience items that either stores benefit from selling, or that large quantities of people could need. Services would be an online system for people to collaborate and communicate on which products they want to bulk purchase. Transactions could be supported by credit card transactions or PayPal.

**Task:** Closely link your customer segment(s) needs and wants to the value propositions of your online business.
	<br /> -People want to pay lower prices for everyday items. We want to provide a way to sell items at a cheaper cost through the value of bulk purchasing.

**Task:** Describe your customer segment(s) clearly and in detail. Then provide a complete overview of the online business, including a clear description of the line of products and/or services. Given that the initial line of products or services is commonly a starting point rather than a full selection, indicate how the product or service goals are expected develop over the next five years.
<br /> -Our customer segment is middle class society that has a direct interest in value and affordability for household products. Several niche customer segments include college students who are very interested in cost minimization, as well as small businesses who need a consistent and local form of transportation for acquiring mass products. Our online business will function as an online shopping service that allows people to request products, and once a product query has reached a certain quantity threshold, that product will be delivered to our businesses warehouses, where they are eventually distributed. We believe the most economically feasible products to begin with are grocery products - fruits, vegetables, canned goods, etc. After 2 years of economic success, we will increase product diversity by moving into household products such as cleaners. After 5 years, we will delve into bulk electronics. Seeing 20 years into the future, it is not economically impossible that we could investigate the sale of bulk yachts and private jets.
